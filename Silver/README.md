# PLEASE NOTE:

So, I am aware that the metal in SFS is already silver, and that this texture is basically competely useless,
HOWEVER it is still *slightly* differn't from SFS. Being ever so lightly brighter and with a slightly altered reflectiveness.

I did have 2 verisons of this texture, the other one was actually differnet from the default, but I wanted it to be 
realistic so i went with this verison.
