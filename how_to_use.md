# How To Use *The Basics* For SFS Steam

Using 100% of *The Basics* textures is NOT RECOMMENED. This can cause lag when selecting a texture (after selected, there will be no problems)

If you want to use, for example the red colors (Dark, Pastel & Normal) simplly go to ``Downloads > The_Basics_v0.1 > Ulitmate_Colors (v1) > Reds`` and multiselect ``red_d``, ``red_n``, and ``red_p`` by right click and dragging and use ``Ctrl+V``, then open steam, go to SFS, click the gear icon and go to ``Manage > Browse Local Files``, which will open a file dictectatory then go from where you are to ``Spaceflight Simulator Game > Spacefllight Simulator_Data > Custom Assets > Parts`` and run ``Ctrl+V``. Now there should be your 3 textures pasted in, with a ``.png``, and ``config.txt`` file in each. Now your all done! Simply restart your game and next time you select a texture, you should have your *The Basics* textures!
